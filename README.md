# MeleeDB
SQL database created by PJ Onusconich and Dale Hartman compiling national tournament results from the competitive scene of Super Smash Bros Melee.

This project was part of the course curriculum for Bucknell's intro to databases course. The project focused on:
-Designing proper schema for a real-world database with sizable data
-Implementing a multi-table database that allows the user to issue various kinds of queries through a web interface
-Populating the database with data from a collection of CSV files (or directly from spreadsheet(s)
-Identifying and setting up proper constraints and their triggers on the database so that if any data becomes erroneous, warning message(s) will be generated and presented
